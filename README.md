# Queermunity
a forum based community website targeted towards LGBTQ+ youth

# Description
This website was made as a group project for Girls Who Code, and
our members decided to create and present something that could
model a safe space for LGBTQ+ users. The website wasn't 100%
completed at the time of the presentation, and some of its features
have gone out of date, but it serves as a blueprint for a more practical
recreation in the future.
